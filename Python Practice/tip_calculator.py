# #round() will always return as a float even with one decimal. Will not show 0 in 2nd decimal.

#instructor's input
# tip_as_percent = tip / 100
# total_tip_amount = bill * tip_as_percent
# total_bill = bill + total_tip_amount
# bill_per_person = total_bill / people
# final_amount = round(bill_per_person, 2)

# print(f"${final_amount}") #still shows as one decimal if the bill is a total of no decimal e.g 150


# Original Code:
# tip_from_percentage = tip / 100
# add_with_one = 1 + tip_from_percentage
# total = (bill * tip_from_percentage) / people
# final_amount = round(total, 2)
#
# print("$" + str(final_amount))
